When Words Fall into Place: Zipf’s Law and the Language of Machines
_A Comparative Analysis of Statistical Distributions in Human and LLM-Generated Texts_

**Research Question**

Do large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral produce word frequency distributions that follow Zipf’s Law in the same way human
language does? If deviations exist, can these statistical differences be systemat-
ically quantified to understand the linguistic properties and “human-likeness”
of LLM-generated text?
