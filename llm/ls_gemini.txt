Life Is Short

It’s a funny thing, time. We measure it in coffee spoons and Netflix episodes, in the countdown to a vacation and the blur of a busy workweek. We’re always trying to save it, to manage it, to stretch it just a little bit further. But the one thing we can’t do is make more of it. Life is short. We know this. We see it in the gray hairs that sneak up on us, in the way our friends’ kids suddenly have kids of their own, in the gut-punch of losing someone we love. And yet, for the most part, we live as if we’re immortal.

I remember my grandfather, a man who seemed as permanent as the oak tree in his backyard. He had a workshop filled with half-finished projects: a birdhouse, a bookshelf, a model airplane. He was always going to get to them “someday.” But someday never came. When he passed away, we were left with the beautiful, heartbreaking evidence of a life that ran out of time. His workshop became a museum of good intentions, a quiet testament to the fact that “later” is a promise that’s not always kept.

We all have our own version of that workshop, don’t we? That language we’re going to learn, that instrument we’re going to master, that relationship we’re going to mend. We put our dreams on layaway, assuming we’ll have time to pick them up when things are less crazy, when we have more money, when the kids are grown. But life has a way of staying crazy. The perfect moment never arrives. And in the meantime, we fill our days with a thousand other things.

It’s not that we’re lazy or undisciplined. It’s that we’re human, and we’re wired for the here and now. We’re drawn to the immediate gratification of a social media scroll, the easy comfort of a familiar routine, the seductive illusion of productivity that comes from a full inbox. We’re so busy managing the minutiae of our lives that we forget to ask ourselves if this is the life we actually want to be living.

I once spent a whole weekend trying to optimize my digital workflow. I downloaded apps, I created folders, I color-coded my calendar. I was convinced that if I could just get organized enough, I could finally get ahead of the game. On Sunday night, as I sat back to admire my handiwork, I felt a sudden, crushing emptiness. I had spent 48 precious hours of my one and only life organizing my to-do list, a list that was mostly filled with things I didn’t even want to do. I hadn’t talked to my family, I hadn’t gone for a walk, I hadn’t read a single page of a book. I had simply rearranged the deck chairs on my own personal Titanic.

That was a wake-up call for me. I realized that the real problem wasn’t my workflow; it was my priorities. I was so focused on being efficient that I had forgotten to be intentional. I was letting my life be dictated by a series of obligations and expectations, many of which I had unconsciously imposed on myself.

As we get older, the things that once seemed so important start to lose their shine. The promotions, the possessions, the social status—they all begin to feel a bit like Monopoly money. We start to realize that the real currency of life is not what we have, but who we are and how we love. The late-night conversations, the shared laughter, the moments of quiet connection—these are the things that make a life rich. These are the memories that will sustain us when everything else has faded away.

But here’s the rub: in our hyper-connected, productivity-obsessed world, these are the very things that are easiest to sacrifice. We’re so tethered to our devices, so addicted to the dopamine hit of a new notification, that we’ve forgotten how to be present. We’re with our kids, but we’re also checking our email. We’re out to dinner with friends, but we’re also scrolling through Instagram. We’re so afraid of missing out on what’s happening online that we’re missing out on what’s happening right in front of us.

The irony is that the more we try to cram into our lives, the less we actually experience. We’re so busy documenting our moments that we forget to live them. We’re so focused on curating a perfect-looking life that we forget to cultivate a happy one. We’re so caught up in the race to the future that we’re missing the beauty of the present.

So what’s the answer? I don’t think it’s about quitting our jobs and moving to a cabin in the woods, as tempting as that may sound some days. I think it’s about a shift in perspective. It’s about recognizing that time is not a renewable resource, and that how we spend our days is how we spend our lives. It’s about being more intentional about where we put our attention, and more ruthless about cutting out the things that don’t matter.

It’s about choosing a walk in the woods over a scroll through your newsfeed. It’s about turning off your phone when you’re with people you love. It’s about saying no to things that don’t light you up, and yes to the things that do. It’s about embracing the quiet, the slow, the "unproductive" moments that are actually the most productive of all, because they’re the moments where we connect with ourselves, with each other, and with the world around us.

Life is short. This is not a tragedy; it’s a truth. It’s a truth that can either paralyze us with fear or liberate us to live more fully. It can be a constant source of anxiety, or it can be a daily reminder to be grateful, to be brave, to be kind. The choice is ours. We can continue to live as if we have all the time in the world, or we can start living as if we don’t. We can keep our dreams in the workshop, or we can take them out and start building them, one messy, imperfect, beautiful day at a time.
