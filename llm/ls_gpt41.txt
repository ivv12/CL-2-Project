Life Is Short: Reflections for a Distracted Age

I’ve lost count of the number of times I’ve heard the phrase “life is short.” It pops up in Instagram captions, on coffee mugs, in movies, and often as unsolicited advice from someone trying to urge you into quitting your job or booking that flight to Bali. It's the kind of phrase that’s become both profound and, frankly, a little overused. Yet despite its overexposure, the longer I live, the more I begin to feel its truth vibrating quietly beneath the surface of the everyday. And it’s taken some unexpected life moments—and more than a few pointless hours doomscrolling my phone—to bring it into sharp focus.

As a kid, the idea that life could be “short” felt absurd. Summers stretched out forever. Waiting for the next birthday was an eternity and a half. My priorities were laughably simple: finish my homework, convince my parents to get me ice cream, spend as long as possible playing video games before they kicked me outside. There was no sense of urgency, no feeling that time was something to be counted or cleverly divided up. It was basically daylight, meals, and sleep, looping in an endless carousel.

But something strange happens when you hit adulthood. Time doesn’t just speed up—it starts to fold in on itself. You blink and a week slips by. You promise to call an old friend “soon,” and suddenly “soon” is six months later, and the only thing that’s actually changed is the price of eggs. Somewhere between school and entering the workforce, the illusion of infinite time shatters. The hours in a day feel as though they’ve contracted and now come with hidden fees.

What’s more, the world is louder and full of more distractions than ever. My phone is an entire universe in itself, filled with infinite scroll feeds, group chats, calendar notifications, New York Times alerts, and enough podcasts to fill a dozen lifetimes. I often find myself toggling between six browser tabs, “catching up” on emails, checking Twitter (now X, but I’ll never get used to that), and then trying to remember why I opened my laptop in the first place. Occasionally, after one of these particularly unproductive multi-tasking spirals, I’ll look up at the clock and realize an hour has vanished. And for what? I have no idea.

It strikes me that a lot of modern life is lived on autopilot. Somewhere along the line, for the sake of efficiency or progress, we started gauging our days by productivity—checking off tasks, responding to messages, keeping plates spinning—and lost the thread of what actually matters. Maybe it’s not all our fault. The machine is designed that way, right? Every app is fighting for your attention, every employer is demanding you do more with less, and the collective mood of the internet seems perpetually anxious, forever shifting from one momentary outrage to the next.

And while I’m not here to wax poetic and urge everyone to toss their smartphones into the ocean, I do think we’ve lost a kind of mindful presence. I see it in myself, running on caffeine and podcasts so I don’t “waste time” during my commute. I see it in my friends, crowding our group chat with memes and non-stop notifications, but struggling to coordinate actual facetime (the human kind, not the app). Sometimes, it takes a jolt—a sudden illness, the passing of someone you didn’t think could ever be absent, or even just noticing how your parents seem to have gotten older overnight—to snap you back to attention.

A few years ago, I bumped into an old college buddy I hadn’t seen since graduation. We grabbed coffee, laughed about old times, and talked about the future with an optimism that now feels almost naive. We promised to stay in touch. He died in a car accident three months later. I remember scrolling through our last texts, all jokes and future plans, and feeling a sharp sense of how randomly and painfully short life can be. There was no warning. No time to tie up loose ends. The week after his funeral, I made an effort to reach out to people I cared about, to say things I normally left unspoken. But, I’ll admit, the urgency faded with time, swallowed by the rhythms of ordinary life.

The thing is, even when we know life is short—when we really feel it—it’s easy to slip back into old habits. Priorities shift, but not always in direct response to our values. We want to spend more quality time with family, but work deadlines loom. We long to travel or start that creative project, yet we get mired in errands and obligations. I sometimes joke that I need a vacation just to make time to plan a vacation.

But the experiences that stick with me aren’t the big-ticket moments—the epic road trips or the Instagram-worthy meals. They’re small, humble episodes: a quiet dinner with my parents; an evening spent playing board games with friends; listening, really listening, to someone tell me about their day. One of my favorite memories is from a nondescript Tuesday evening, sitting on my apartment balcony with my roommate, sharing cheap wine, swapping silly stories, and watching the sun dip below the city skyline. Nothing “significant” happened, but I remember laughing so hard my sides ached and feeling, for once, completely present.

Modern life pushes us toward distraction, and when we’re distracted, we forget how precious—and how limited—our time is. It’s not just that life is short; it’s that so much of what fills it is noise. I’ve slowly started to become more intentional about how I spend my hours, not by making radical life changes, but by paying closer attention. Some days this just means putting my phone in another room while I read. Other days, it means genuinely prioritizing my health, or saying no to commitments out of sheer self-preservation. I’m learning to celebrate the ordinary, to chase the moments that feel real instead of those that look good from the outside.

Admittedly, it’s a work in progress. I still get trapped in email loops and pointless internet debates. I still binge-watch whole seasons of television just to escape my own brain. But the awareness that life is short—that any day could be the one when time runs out—keeps me trying. It nudges me to forgive more quickly, to express gratitude more readily, to schedule coffee dates rather than just trade “we should hangs.” It encourages me to take my passion projects off the back burner, to actually inhabit this body, this time, this version of myself while I can.

When I hear “life is short” these days, I try not to roll my eyes. Instead, I imagine it as an invitation. Not to live recklessly or seek constant adventure, but to be quietly, fiercely present in my own, ordinary life. To remember that it’s the messy, unassuming moments that add up to something meaningful. And to make sure, whenever possible, that my attention is right here—because that, in the end, might be the most we can do with this short, miraculous time we’re given.
