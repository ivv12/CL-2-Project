The Shortness of Life: A Reflection on Time, Priorities, and Distractions

There’s this recurring thought I have, a quiet echo that hums through my day like background noise: Life is short. It’s a thought that comes and goes, fleeting but persistent, and it’s usually triggered by something small—seeing a friend I haven’t spoken to in ages, hearing a song that takes me back to a time I barely remember, or noticing how quickly a season shifts from one to the next. Time seems to move faster the older I get, like a clock winding down on a game I don’t remember starting. And I can’t help but wonder—if life is short, how am I spending it? Am I really doing what matters?

It’s easy to lose track of time, especially in this world of endless distractions. In the age of constant connectivity, time has become both precious and cheap. It slips through our fingers without us even realizing it—one scroll, one click, one “quick check” of email that somehow turns into an hour-long rabbit hole. The paradox is that while we’re all acutely aware that life is finite, it feels like we’ve all somehow agreed to fill up the spaces between moments with things that don’t actually matter all that much.

It’s strange, really. We all know, deep down, that we don’t have forever. And yet, we get caught in the weeds of the present moment—focusing on the mundane, the trivial, the seemingly important but ultimately inconsequential. But what if we didn’t? What if we lived like life *was* short, really embraced that, and made our choices with the kind of purpose we only seem to muster when we’re confronted with an actual loss or a real reminder of our mortality?

I’ve had a few of those moments lately, moments that caused me to pause and ask, “Am I spending my time wisely?” The first was when a childhood friend reached out after years of silence. We used to spend hours together, laughing about nothing, arguing over stupid things, sharing our hopes and fears like it was a matter of life and death. But time—time just got away from us. People move, careers take over, we get caught in the rush. I remember the last time we saw each other: a casual goodbye at the airport, thinking we’d catch up soon. But we didn’t. And when my friend messaged me out of the blue, I realized how many years had slipped by, unnoticed. Suddenly, I wanted to reclaim those lost moments—to reconnect, to pick up the phone more often, to stop waiting for the "perfect" time that never comes.

This is the paradox of modern life. We’re hyper-aware of how quickly time passes, but the speed of everything around us encourages us to postpone. We get busy with work, with obligations, with social media “checking in” on others' lives, and we forget to check in on our own. Time doesn’t care about your to-do list, your deadlines, or how many times you’ve posted on Instagram. Time moves on, whether you’re ready for it or not.

It’s funny how we talk about time as if it’s a resource we can manage, that we can just “find” more of it by getting organized, cutting out distractions, or waking up earlier. The reality, though, is that we don’t actually *control* time. We can only control how we spend it. And we often spend it in ways that don’t add up to much. Think about it: How many hours have you spent on social media this week? How many minutes did you waste on something that, in the grand scheme of things, doesn’t matter at all? We’re all guilty of it. Time becomes something we squander without even thinking.

A few months ago, I took a solo trip to a remote cabin in the mountains to “reset.” No Wi-Fi, no TV, just nature and me. I thought I’d use the time to work on a book I’d been meaning to write, read, meditate, and generally improve myself. I even made a list of goals before I went, as if being away from distractions would make me magically productive. But when I got there, something surprising happened: I didn’t want to do anything. I felt overwhelmed by how much I *thought* I should be doing. Instead of sitting down to write, I spent hours looking out the window at the trees and the sky, letting the silence wrap around me like a blanket. I realized that, for the first time in ages, I wasn’t filling the time with the usual noise. I wasn’t checking my phone, answering emails, or juggling a hundred things at once. And in that space, I had an epiphany: We’re all so busy running from one thing to the next that we forget to *just be.* We’re so used to filling up every minute of our lives with something “productive” that we forget that doing nothing, or doing something just for the joy of it, is just as important.

I think that’s where the real challenge lies. Life is short, yes. But it’s not short in the way we think. It’s not short in the “I have to do everything now” kind of way, but in the “don’t waste a single minute on what doesn’t truly matter” kind of way. The things that really matter—the relationships we nurture, the experiences we cherish, the growth we pursue—those things don’t happen when we’re stuck in a cycle of mindless activity. They happen when we step back, when we allow ourselves to pause, to be present in the moment, and to connect with what truly brings us joy or meaning.

It’s easy to be distracted. But in a world that demands so much of our attention, maybe the most radical thing we can do is to reclaim our time. And that doesn’t mean we need to quit our jobs, cut off all our social connections, or live in the mountains like a hermit. It means making conscious choices about how we spend the hours we’re given. It means choosing to spend time with people who matter, choosing to be present when we’re with them, and choosing to step away from the noise when we need to. It means remembering that time, once spent, is gone forever, and that we can’t afford to waste it.

When I look back at my life in the future—whether it’s in a few years, a decade, or whenever the time comes—I don’t want to regret all the moments I let slip by unnoticed. I want to be able to say that I lived fully, that I spent my time in ways that felt meaningful, that I didn’t let distractions take me off course. Life is short, yes. But maybe, just maybe, that’s the best reason to start paying closer attention to how we spend it.
