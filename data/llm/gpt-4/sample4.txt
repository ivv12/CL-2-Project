In the past few years, I’ve found myself increasingly frustrated by the relentless speed at which everything moves. It’s not just the rush of daily life that grates on me—though that’s certainly part of it—but the overwhelming sense that the pace of modern existence is out of sync with the more deliberate, thoughtful rhythm I long for. Time seems to slip away unnoticed, with a constant sense of urgency, distraction, and the subtle but insistent pressure of “more.” More tasks, more content, more interactions, more to do, more to have, more to be. It feels like we’re all running on a treadmill that keeps speeding up, but somehow we’re still not getting anywhere.

I’ve caught myself in the middle of these small moments where I stop and ask: How did I get here? Why do I feel like I’m always catching up, always trying to “do” something, even when it feels like none of it matters? The sense of meaning that once seemed tied to deep work, to reflection, to connection, seems increasingly diluted, or worse, replaced with the hollow din of constant distraction. I’ve tried to explain this feeling to others, only to be met with confused shrugs or sympathetic nods, as though we’re all collectively too busy to stop and really think about why it feels like we’re stuck in this loop.

The irony, of course, is that we live in an age where there has never been more information, more access to resources, more tools to help us make the most of our time. Everything we could possibly need or want is a click away—news, entertainment, social media, online learning, and work tools, all designed to keep us plugged in, constantly aware, and endlessly engaged. And yet, this hyperconnectedness doesn’t seem to bring us any closer to meaning. Instead, it often feels like it only widens the gap between what we’re doing and why we’re doing it.

I think a lot about time. Time, in the modern sense, is something that feels incredibly fragile and fleeting, even as we’re encouraged to believe it’s something we can control. I have apps on my phone that tell me how much time I’ve spent on different tasks—how many hours I’ve spent scrolling through social media or checking my email or watching videos that promise to “change my life.” And then, somewhere between a scroll and a click, I’ll find myself thinking about the last three hours I’ve just frittered away, only to realize that I can’t recall a single thing I’ve learned or enjoyed from those hours. There was no growth, no reward, nothing that made the time spent feel like it had meaning. That’s what’s so disorienting: the constant bombardment of data and entertainment, of things to consume, but none of it ever filling that deeper, more human need for purpose or connection. The hours don’t feel like they’re mine anymore.

This fragmentation of time—of attention—isn’t just a result of technology, though. It’s also a symptom of a deeper cultural shift, one that seems to prize efficiency, productivity, and multitasking over depth, presence, and focus. We’ve internalized this notion that the more we can do, the more valuable we become. We measure our worth in output, in our ability to juggle multiple demands, to meet deadlines, to be constantly “on.” And this is where I think modern life gets tricky: the more we chase efficiency and productivity, the more we lose sight of the things that truly matter.

The feeling of being constantly busy has become a sort of badge of honor. It’s as though we have to prove our worth through action, through filling every minute with something, even if that something is nothing of real substance. Our work becomes our identity, our sense of who we are. And the problem is that the very tools we use to get work done—the very tools that were supposed to make our lives easier—have become tools of distraction. Phones, computers, tablets, all designed to help us focus, are constantly pulling our attention in a million directions. Notifications pinging, emails stacking up, messages demanding responses. We are, essentially, drowning in a sea of trivialities, all of which promise something—something important, something urgent—but which, in the end, offer little more than a brief distraction from the bigger questions we often leave unasked.

I’ve had days where I wake up with a list of things to do—a list that grows throughout the day as tasks pile on, each one feeling like an important step towards some final goal. But when I look back at the end of the day, I realize that while I’ve crossed many things off that list, the things I actually cared about, the things that were meaningful to me, never made it on there. I’ve learned to appreciate the quiet moments more now. The moments where I’m not chasing anything, not looking at my phone, not answering an email, not even thinking about what’s next. But those moments are increasingly rare, and even when they do appear, they often feel like interruptions to the grand project of productivity. This has become a new kind of tension: the desire for depth and meaning against the relentless, ingrained impulse to keep moving, to keep doing, to keep achieving.

Sometimes, I’ll retreat to something that feels more grounded—reading a book, walking outside, cooking a meal from scratch—and I’ll realize just how rare it is to experience something without it being connected to some goal or end result. The joy of reading a book used to be in the simple act of reading itself, but now, I often find myself thinking about how many books I can read in a year, how fast I can get through a novel, how much I can learn from it. The experience becomes secondary to the goal of completing it. This kind of efficiency-driven mindset is pervasive, and in many ways, it’s hard to escape. We’re told that time is money, that every minute spent doing something should lead to some productive outcome. But the more I lean into this mindset, the more I realize that the price we pay is an erosion of our ability to be present, to fully engage with the task at hand without the nagging sense that we should be doing something else.

Part of the problem, I think, is that we’ve lost a clear sense of what it means to live a meaningful life in the context of modern society. In the past, perhaps, meaning was tied more directly to simple, concrete things: family, work, faith, personal achievement. But now, meaning seems to be something we have to chase, something that eludes us, even as we’re surrounded by more “opportunities” than ever. The idea that a meaningful life could be something we simply experience—something that doesn’t need to be dissected, analyzed, or optimized—feels increasingly foreign. We’re told that we must have a purpose, that we must be striving toward some greater goal, and that if we’re not, then we’re wasting our time. But the real truth, I think, is that meaning is found not in the endless pursuit of “more,” but in the ability to sit with the present moment and let it unfold without expectation. It’s the stillness that allows us to actually feel the world around us, to connect with others, to discover something deeper about ourselves.

Perhaps the hardest part of this realization is that the culture we live in doesn’t really allow for stillness. We’re constantly bombarded with reminders that there’s always more to do, always more to consume, always more to learn. But I’ve begun to see that the only way to truly reclaim our time, and with it, our attention, is to step back from the relentless drive for more and rediscover the value of less: less distraction, less noise, less expectation. We don’t need to do more to find meaning. We need to do less, so that we can finally hear what life is trying to tell us.
