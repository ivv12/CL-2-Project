We live in a world that is constantly on the move. It is a world where everything seems to be accelerating, and we are supposed to keep up. If we don’t, we risk falling behind, becoming irrelevant, or simply losing track of what matters. Time feels as though it’s slipping through our fingers, and no matter how hard we try to grasp it, it keeps moving faster. The pressure to keep up with the pace of modern life can be overwhelming, leaving us to wonder: What is all of this for? And how do we make sense of the things that really matter when everything around us is designed to pull our attention in a thousand different directions?

A few years ago, I found myself scrolling through my phone late into the night, the blue light from the screen casting an artificial glow on my face. I had opened a social media app, just to check in for a moment, but hours passed before I realized how much time had slipped away. I was checking updates, mindlessly liking posts, and scrolling past images of people I had never met. I had convinced myself that I was “catching up” on the world, staying informed, or maybe even connecting in some distant, digital way. But when I finally put the phone down, I felt empty. I had spent hours of my life consumed by a collection of curated lives, flashing before me in an endless stream of notifications, updates, and images that were supposed to keep me engaged. Instead, I felt disconnected—from others, yes, but more so from myself. I had allowed myself to be distracted, but worse, I had allowed my attention to become fragmented, split across a thousand inconsequential things.

This moment was the beginning of a realization that has only deepened with time: we are not just living in a world that is speeding up; we are being conditioned to speed up, too. In the modern age, everything has to happen now. The present moment has become a constant rush, driven by the desire to achieve more, consume more, and move faster. We are constantly being told that we can have it all and that we can have it now—our work, our dreams, our relationships, our pleasures—everything at our fingertips, in real time. The pressure to keep pace with this idealized version of life can lead us to forget the true meaning of time, of attention, and of work itself.

What does it mean to live with intention in a world that is designed to distract? How do we navigate the constant pull of the now, without losing ourselves in the process?

I think a big part of the challenge is that we have lost a sense of what it means to “be” in the world rather than simply “do” in it. In the rush to accomplish and achieve, we forget that not every moment needs to be filled with productivity or progress. There is something incredibly powerful in the quiet, in moments of stillness. But stillness is increasingly rare. We’ve traded moments of contemplation for the hum of constant notifications and the buzz of the next task on our to-do list. And in doing so, we have lost the ability to be present with ourselves.

Time, as a concept, has become something to be managed rather than something to be experienced. The clock no longer marks the rhythm of the day—it’s a countdown, an ever-present reminder of how much we have left to do. As we check our watches, our phones, and our calendars, we’re reminded that time is running out, that the minutes are slipping away. The pressure mounts to fill each of those minutes with something productive, meaningful, or, at the very least, something that will make us feel like we’ve accomplished something. But what happens when we take a step back and look at the bigger picture? When we stop measuring time in minutes, hours, or even days, and instead begin to ask: What do I want from this life? What is worth my attention?

The more I reflect on the pace of modern life, the more I realize that we have lost sight of meaning in favor of productivity. Work has become a central part of our identities, and success is too often defined by the amount of output we can generate, the number of emails we can send, or the number of tasks we can check off. But the real question is: What is the value of all that work? Does it add up to anything more than a series of fleeting moments of achievement, followed by the next task, the next deadline, the next cycle of doing?

I’ve come to believe that we need to shift our focus from work as an endless cycle of “doing” to work as a part of a larger, more intentional life. It is easy to get trapped in the belief that if we just work harder, work faster, work smarter, we’ll eventually reach a place of contentment, of fulfillment. But it doesn’t work like that. The cycle never ends. The more you do, the more there is to do. It’s a game you can’t win, because the goalposts keep moving. We need to redefine success not as a constant stream of tasks, but as moments of depth and meaning, even in the simplest of acts.

At the same time, I think we need to reclaim our attention. In a world where everything is designed to grab our focus, we are losing our ability to choose where our attention goes. Instead of being present with what we are doing, we are constantly being pulled away, lured by the bright lights of digital distractions. I’ve noticed how often I can be in the middle of a conversation or a task, only to be interrupted by the ping of a phone notification or the urge to check something online. It’s not just the phone, either—it’s the constant bombardment of news, ads, and messages, each of them fighting for our attention, each of them telling us that we need to be engaged, to know more, to act faster.

And yet, in the midst of all this distraction, we are losing the capacity for deep attention. The kind of attention that allows us to really engage with a person, a book, a project, or even our own thoughts. The kind of attention that gives us the space to reflect, to be present with what is, without the need for constant interruption or external validation. It’s a kind of attention that allows us to experience time differently—more slowly, more meaningfully.

I’ve started experimenting with ways to reclaim my attention. One of the simplest practices I’ve found is just to stop and take a deep breath. When I feel the urge to check my phone or jump into another task, I pause, breathe, and ask myself: Is this the most important thing right now? It’s a small act, but it has become a way of returning to the present moment, of refocusing on what matters. I try to make space for things that require sustained attention, whether that’s reading a book, having a long conversation, or even just sitting in silence. These moments are rare, but they are also precious. They remind me that time, when experienced fully, is not an enemy to be conquered, but a gift to be savored.

In some ways, I think we need a collective rethinking of how we approach modern life. We have built systems that reward speed and efficiency, but we have also created environments that make it nearly impossible to experience the richness of life in its fullness. There is a real cost to living at the pace we do, a cost that often goes unnoticed until we are overwhelmed or burnt out. To slow down, to reclaim our attention, and to live with intention is not an act of rebellion—it is an act of survival. It is a way of remembering that we are human, not machines.

As I look around at the world we live in, I see both the beauty and the chaos of our modern age. There is so much potential for connection, for growth, and for joy. But it’s up to us to slow down enough to see it, to engage with it. The next time I find myself scrolling endlessly through a feed or rushing to the next task, I hope I remember that the most important thing is not to be productive, but to be present—to feel the pulse of time without letting it slip through my fingers. Because in the end, time is the only thing we can’t get back. And if we don’t learn to live with intention, we may miss the moments that really matter.
