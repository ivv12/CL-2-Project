On Sunday mornings my phone delivers a tidy graph of my attention. A translucent rectangle shows that I spent three hours and forty-nine  minutes staring into it yesterday, and for some reason the exactness embarrasses me more than the total. Three hours and forty-nine minutes. Had it been four, maybe I could have shrugged and called it a round number, a fact of modern life; had it been three, I might have congratulated myself for restraint. But three-forty-nine feels like a verdict, a teacher’s red pen along the margin of the day: You drifted here, you broke focus there, you hovered over a thread that didn’t require your presence at all. The machine doesn’t care whether those minutes were necessary or meaningful; it records them the way a tide gauge records the harbor, rise and fall, rise and fall.

I carry that little embarrassment around like a pebble in my shoe while I make coffee. The kettle takes as long as it always has—time is still faithful to its method—but I have the feeling that the rest of the world has been smearing it thin, like butter over too much toast. My grandparents’ kitchen had a clock with hands that swept, and sometimes I imagine that the sweep itself produced patience in them. If you’re forced to watch the incremental motion of a minute hand, you might become less likely to count life in tick marks. My own clocks are digits, numbers that break time into units that can be laminated into calendars, sliced into fifteen-minute meetings, optimized, shared, tracked. I’ve often wondered whether the fascination with optimizing time is less about getting more done and more about neutralizing anxiety. If I can control the calendar, I tell myself, I won’t be ambushed by emptiness. The spreadsheet will be my shield against dread.

Work has taught me much about the shape of that dread. I sit in front of a screen like everyone I know, and though the particulars of my tasks are very different from the people I pass on my street, we seem to share a feeling that our labor is a kind of abstraction. I send fragments to other fragments—messages that hop across platforms, files that live in clouds. I don’t lift anything heavier than a mug; my body is only occasionally involved beyond my fingertips and my eyes. It’s not that the work lacks value. Ideas, decisions, designs: they matter. But they can feel suspiciously like vapor when the day has been whittled by notifications, when I say “we made progress” but can’t point to something you could set on a table. Because of that, I catch myself snacking on visible busyness. I reply quickly, I keep the green dot lit, I keep a browser tab open with a spreadsheet I don’t need, the way I used to keep a textbook open nearby to imply diligence. I confuse witnessable motion with meaning, and my tools encourage me in this confusion.

The truth is, distraction is not my enemy; it’s my reflection. When my attention slips, it tells me two things at once. On one side, I am wired to seek novelty and rewards as surely as my dog is wired to sniff the base of every lamp post; little red badges are the equivalent of someone calling my name in a crowd, and answering them feels like proof that I am still in a story. On the other side, I am probably avoiding something I fear: a task that might expose my ignorance, a decision that closes off other possible selves, a blank hour that refuses to tell me what it is for. Boredom and dread wear the same coat in my mind, and when they walk into the room I tend to usher them into the kitchen and ply them with snacks. I look for them on my phone; I scroll with the hope that they will get bored first and leave. They don’t.

The most honest experiment I’ve performed in years involved no grand rules or monkish vows. I turned my phone to grayscale for a week. The first day I kept checking it out of habit and found myself mildly irritated at how the games looked like photocopies of themselves, how the little red badges had faded into ambers and greys. On the third day, I caught a strange quiet creeping into the edges of my concentration. It wasn’t that I had removed the capacity for distraction; I had merely made the loop uglier, like putting frayed tape over the light switch. This wasn’t transcendence. But something inside me softened with the removal of an appeal. The week didn’t change my life. It did remind me that attention is not only a resource but a mood, and moods can be at least partly furnished by the room we are in.

I say that and immediately want to argue with myself. If attention is a mood, as fickle and weather-like as that, does that mean I am at its mercy? The answer seems to be a practical kind of humility. There are days when I will not write the elegant paragraph; there are days when the inbox wins and I am more accountant than artist. Pretending otherwise sets me up for self-contempt. And I have discovered that self-contempt is one of the fastest engines of distraction. When I feel behind, I feel ashamed, and then shame wants to be numbed, and the numbing pings me with a respectful notification tone. The escape hatch becomes the hall I live in. So lately I have been paying attention to the small rituals that help me stay in the room with my life. Sometimes they are absurdly small. I keep a paper notebook on my desk, and when I feel the urge to hop away, I draw a box and write what I am avoiding inside it. Often it is as simple as “email Sam.” Seeing the overcast little word “email” fenced into a rectangle makes it weirdly manageable. I promise myself that I only need to do what is in that one box. When I finish, I shade it in like a child coloring a star on a report card. The shading is far more satisfying than the checkmark in an app. It is a tangible moment of having finished something, however small.

This, I think, is what I miss about manual work. When I was a teenager I took a summer job painting fences for a neighbor with more land than he could maintain. In the morning we would load the truck with cans and rollers, and by lunch a few posts would be brighter; by evening the fence had moved forward, linear and real. The line between effort and outcome was not clean—weather, wood, the quirks of paint—but I could stand at the end of a day and put my hand on what had changed. When I finish a day of contemporary work, I look back over the valley of my hours, and the topography is uneven, a series of shallow dips and peaks. This brings me back to the graph my phone provides me on Sundays. I don’t actually want a chart; I want a fence.

It’s tempting to blame the pace of contemporary life for everything I dislike about the contents of my days. Trains are faster, emails are faster, deliveries are faster, outrage is faster, and so the mind feels like it has to be faster. But speed is not the problem, at least not alone. I am grateful every time I can reach a friend on the other side of the world while I am still standing in my kitchen. Fastness can be generosity. The problem is that so many things that used to be slow enough to let meaning sediment have become fast enough to remain perpetually in suspension. When everything is equally present at the same time—news, work, friends, advertising, art, grief—it all shimmers like silt in water that has been stirred. It is harder to see what sinks to the bottom as valuable. It is harder to know what is enough. When everything is possible all the time, the shape of my choice hardens into anxiety.

On a weekday not long ago, I stood at a crosswalk with a dozen other people, all of us waiting for the little person to turn white. I noticed the man next to me reach into his pocket and glance at his phone; I did the same without meaning to. There is something both moving and sad about this reflex. Moving, because it shows that we are all trying to stitch our days into coherence with tiny threads of information; sad, because it hints at how allergic we are to unfilled moments. I tried an experiment and did nothing for the length of the red hand. I just stood. The wind was rougher than I had let it be in my mind; the  exhaust from the bus made the air feel bulkier; the building across the street had a net draped half over the scaffolding that made the sunlight into a grid on the sidewalk. It was not a great revelation. But there was a small quiet in it that felt like a seed.

I am aware of how small my experiments sound. I am aware too of the privilege behind my choices. The pace of many people’s lives is not an aesthetic problem; it is a matter of survival, of childcare and shift work and another bus to catch. That awareness is part of why I resist the fantasy of quitting everything and buying land. Most of us are going to remain here, in this loop of pings and obligations, where time is less a field than a series of boxes on a screen. So the question becomes how to plant anything worth keeping in the soil of a day like that. My answer is not philosophical so much as deliberately domestic. I try to finish things. I make soup that has to sit for ninety minutes. I call my mother and stay on the line when the conversation dips into silence. I give myself what my work rarely gives me: the feeling of continuity. You chop the onion and there it is chopped; you wash the pot and there it is clean. These aren’t acts of resistance so much as acts of sanity. They remind me that meaning is often assembled from tiny completions, as if significance is a quilt made of small squares stitched thoroughly to their neighbors.

There is also the question of attention as a commons, as something we share rather than merely own. If every app and company is trying to carve out a little village within us, then we live with many competing governments. The result is the sensation of being ruled by a committee. I have begun treating my attention as something I owe to other people, at least as much as I owe it to my own goals. When I’m with a friend, I put the phone face down not because I am virtuous but because the second in which my eyes flicker away is a way of saying “a new thing might be more important than you.” I don’t want to say that to someone I care about unless it is actually true. In meetings, I’ve started telling people when I’m going to pause for ten seconds to think before answering a question. It feels awkward every time; it also slows the room down enough for better thoughts to arrive. I reply to messages more slowly than I used to, which has the paradoxical effect of making my eventual replies kinder. The premise behind all of this is a small ethical claim: the pace I choose sets a pace for someone else, and if I choose frenzy I contribute to a collective sense that only frenzy will save us. There is a selfishness in perpetual acceleration rarely acknowledged as such.

That is easy to say and hard to live. One afternoon, a colleague sent me a message marked “time-sensitive,” and I felt the chemical bloom of cortisol curl up from my stomach to my throat. I answered instantly. Later, when I asked what had been at stake, it turned out to be a spreadsheet column that had been mislabeled. Necessary, yes. Urgent, no. I hadn’t asked for clarification because I didn’t want to risk violating the social contract of responsiveness. Politeness had become a speed. And yet, there are true emergencies. The difficulty is that our tools flatten both into the same channel. One reply window for the birth announcement and the billing mistake and the policy decision and the meme. It’s no wonder I sometimes feel like my attention is a tourist trying to speak five languages at once.

The only plausible remedy I’ve found is to reintroduce friction where it has been worn away. I put a slightly annoying passcode on my social apps and an easy one on my banking app. I moved the icons I want to use more often—notes, books, music—to the front of my phone’s little stage and hid the others in a folder called “Later.” Some days I keep the phone in another room and wear a watch with hands. Once a week I walk without headphones and without a destination, which is as close to unproductive as I am able to get. If someone stops me and asks why I’m smiling at nothing, I say that I am giving my mind its required maintenance. As a machine, I am shabby and require oiling. As an animal, I need to move. As a person, I need to locate myself in a place that is bigger than what I can summon with my thumb.

None of this fixes the structural pressures around work and attention. My employer still expects me to answer messages. The world still expects me to be reachable. The graph will likely still scold me on Sundays. But the point of small choices is not to topple systems. It is to give myself a shape I can live with inside them. If the day wants to be a sequence of boxes, I can at least try to fill them with presence. If the week wants to be an arc of meetings and deliveries, I can try to be the kind of person who notices the exact pattern sunlight makes on the sidewalk while waiting for the crosswalk. It sounds like a consolation prize. It might be the prize.

Last night I sat on the balcony as the sky went from white to grey to a kind of bruised purple I only see at certain times of the year. The street was loud. It always is. A moth threw itself again and again at the porch light, and I thought about the story we tell about moths, that they are drawn to the flame for its brightness. In reality, they navigate by the moon. Artificial lights confuse them; they crash because their instrument panel says the wrong thing. I don’t want to overextend the metaphor. But it does feel familiar: using a device designed for one kind of orientation to steer me in a landscape it was not designed for. The moon in this case, if there is one, might be something as plain as the answer to a question I keep avoiding: What is enough? Not how much can I do, not how quickly can I respond, not how many tabs can I keep open in my skull. Enough is sometimes the fence posts I painted when I was seventeen. Enough is sometimes an email that contains one clear sentence. Enough might be an unmeasured hour while the soup simmers.

In the morning, the graph will still be on the screen like a horoscope I tell myself I don’t believe in but secretly glance at. I will still sit in front of my computer and light up the green dot, because that is how our tribes find one another now. I will still be ambushed by the delicious little promise of a new notification and the strange hollowness that follows. But perhaps I will also still draw a box in my notebook and, with some luck, shade it in. I will wait at the crosswalk and look up. There are ways to live with speed that do not ask me to become a spark. There are ways to hold attention that make it something more than a graph. There are ways to carry time that are not a burden but a basket, both strong and woven, large enough to hold what is needed and small enough that I can carry it without resentment. If I can manage that for even part of a day, I have learned enough to call it a good day. I have learned to be a person in a time that measures me and a person who sometimes refuses to be measured. That refusal, modest as it is, feels like the beginning of a life rather than a compromise within it.
