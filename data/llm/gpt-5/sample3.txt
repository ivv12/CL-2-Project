I sometimes think the modern world is held together by a thin membrane of notifications. They flicker at the edges of my attention—small vibrations, glowing badges on screens, the soft chime meant to sound gentle but that lands with the weight of obligation. If I try to picture a single day without them, it feels almost impossible, as if they’ve become part of the architecture of my mind. I wake up to a phone that has already decided what I should look at first. I fall asleep while it whispers the last few bits of the world I didn’t ask to know. Somewhere in the quiet between these moments, I try to recall what I used to think about before the constant stream began. If I am honest, I’m not sure I remember.

It’s not that modern life is uniquely chaotic—every generation insists theirs is the most hurried, the most disorienting—but there is a particular texture to this moment that I can feel in my bones. It’s as though time has become elastic. Whole hours disappear into tasks I don’t remember choosing, swallowed by screens or by the constant micro-adjustments of living. And yet other minutes stretch on, especially when I try to do something without distraction. When I attempt to read a physical book, for example, time slows down so dramatically that it almost feels uncomfortable, like a muscle long out of use being stretched too far. I try to resist the urge to check the time, but the urge itself is a symptom. It reminds me how conditioned I’ve become to expect a rush—some tiny jolt of novelty—to reassure me that I am still plugged into the world.

I sometimes wonder whether this restlessness is simply the cost of living now, or whether I’ve failed to cultivate the kind of attention that deeper forms of living require. There’s a certain romance to imagining oneself as someone capable of quiet—someone who enjoys long, uninterrupted thought, someone whose days aren’t carved into fragments by the buzzing of a pocket-sized device. But the reality is that attention, like any capacity, decays without practice. If I’m honest, the skill I’ve been practicing most consistently over the past decade is rapid task switching, a style of thinking that suits the architecture of the internet but not the architecture of a meaningful life.

Yet the modern world offers such immediacy. Work can be done from anywhere, messages travel with no visible friction, and there’s a quiet amazement in realizing that an entire library can sit in my bag disguised as a rectangle of glass. There is magic in this technology—real, transformative magic—and I don’t want to pretend otherwise. It’s just that magic always has a price. The price here seems to be the erosion of the mundane rhythms that once supported attention: the waiting, the pauses, the moments of boredom when the mind wanders and, in wandering, discovers something unexpected.

I think often about boredom, a feeling I used to dread as a child. Long car rides felt endless, and rainy afternoons held me hostage. But in hindsight, boredom was also the birthplace of imagination. With nothing to distract me, my mind filled the empty space with stories, observations, possibilities. As an adult, I have fewer empty spaces. I’ve learned to eliminate them so efficiently—checking messages in line at the grocery store, listening to podcasts while washing dishes, filling the quiet with music, news, or noise— that boredom has become almost mythical. When it does surface, I reach reflexively for a device. The impulse is automatic, nearly neurological, and usually I’m not even aware I’ve responded to it until the moment has passed.

Sometimes I try to reclaim small moments of slowness. It can feel oddly rebellious. A few months ago, I went for a walk without my phone. My hand felt strangely light, as if I’d left the house without keys. For the first few minutes, I kept reaching toward the pocket where a phone normally rests, expecting the shape to be there. Without it, the walk felt different—less purposeful, more porous. I paid attention to things I usually miss: the uneven rhythm of my steps, the brittle leaves underfoot, the conversation of two strangers drifting toward me before dissolving behind me. I wasn’t productive. I didn’t capture anything. But something about the experience lingered. For a moment, I felt like I’d slipped out of the relentless churn of the modern world and into a slower, older one.

But there’s a tension that arises when I try to live more slowly. The pace of contemporary society isn’t designed for it. Work, especially, has become a kind of performance of responsiveness. To be reachable is to be responsible; to be overwhelmed is to be important. Days fill with messages, tasks, and emails, each one framed as urgent. Even when the work itself is meaningful, the pace at which it must be done can hollow it out. There have been days when I’ve stared at a screen for hours, my eyes buzzing by the end, only to realize that the work I completed feels flimsy, rushed, or forgettable. On those days, the exhaustion feels different from physical tiredness. It feels like I’ve been living at surface level, skimming the surface of my life without dropping into any deeper layer.

I try not to romanticize slowness for its own sake. Life has always contained periods of urgency and intensity. But I do think that modern life has become tilted too far toward speed—toward immediacy, reaction, and constant availability. Time feels compressed, not because there is less of it but because we’ve filled it so densely that it can no longer hold its shape. When I talk with friends about this, most of them nod with recognition. It seems nearly universal: the sense of being stretched thin, the creeping suspicion that we’re living in fast-forward while trying to remember what it felt like to live in play.

The question I return to, again and again, is what it means to live at a humane pace. Not necessarily a slow pace, but one that doesn’t grind down the mind’s capacity for depth. I think it requires a different kind of attention, one that is not so easily seduced by novelty. It requires boundaries around time that the modern world doesn’t naturally offer. It might even require telling ourselves a different story about what matters.

Lately, I’ve tried to pay attention to the texture of experiences rather than their efficiency. A cup of coffee in the morning can be either a rushed fueling or a quiet ritual. Cooking dinner can be either a chore or a grounding act. Even small moments—like washing my hands and noticing the temperature of the water—can serve as tiny anchors, reminders that life is not something to be optimized but something to be inhabited.

Of course, this is easier said than done. I’m as susceptible as anyone to the lure of distraction, and there are days when my attention feels like a page filled with eraser smudges. But I’m beginning to believe that the challenge of modern life isn’t simply managing time; it’s managing awareness. Time moves as it always has, but awareness is what determines the richness of our days. Without it, even the most meaningful activities become noise.

Sometimes I think about the people whose attention I admire. They tend to have a calm quality, an ability to be fully present in conversation or in their work. They don’t rush to fill silence. They move through the world with a kind of inner stillness that seems increasingly rare. When I’ve asked them how they maintain such steadiness, the answer is often disappointingly simple: they build habits that protect their attention. Some meditate. Some keep their phones in another room. Some carve out dedicated time for the things that matter most, even when their schedules are full. None of these habits require special talent—only intention, and perhaps the willingness to feel temporarily uncomfortable while retraining the mind.

There is a kind of courage in that discomfort. Modern life rewards the opposite: constant availability, constant engagement, constant consumption. To step away, even briefly, can feel like falling behind. But I’m beginning to suspect that falling behind might actually mean returning to a pace that humans were never meant to abandon. Perhaps the point isn’t to escape modernity’s pace but to remember that we can choose our relationship to it.

I don’t have a tidy conclusion, because I’m still living this tension every day. But I do know that when I look back at the moments that have felt genuinely meaningful, they rarely align with the speed at which I was moving. They align with depth—with the feeling of being wholly present. They align with times when I wasn’t thinking about what I should be doing next or who I should be responding to but was simply aware of the moment itself. Those moments are the ones that seem to expand time rather than compress it.

Maybe that’s the quiet truth beneath all the noise of modern life: attention is what gives our days their shape. If time feels thin, rushed, or fragmented, perhaps it is because our attention has been scattered. And if we want to reclaim a sense of meaning, perhaps that begins with reclaiming our attention—bit by bit, moment by moment—until the pace of life feels once again like something we can inhabit rather than endure.
