# The Tyranny of the Scroll

There's a moment that happens almost every evening, usually around seven-thirty, when I realize I've lost an hour.  Not lost in the sense that I can't account for it—I know exactly where it went—but lost in that it dissolved into nothing, leaving no residue, no memory, no sense of having experienced time passing at all. I was scrolling.  Through what, exactly, becomes harder to say the moment I stop.  News articles I didn't finish reading. Videos that promised something and delivered a vague sense of having consumed content. The carefully curated anxieties of people I've never met. The hour went somewhere, but I didn't go with it.

This keeps happening, and I keep noticing it with the same mild shock, as if I'm encountering the phenomenon for the first time. There's something almost dreamlike about it—that feeling of surfacing from a state you can't quite remember entering, aware only that time has passed and you have nothing to show for it. We have various terms for this now: doomscrolling, getting lost in the feed, falling down the rabbit hole.  The language we use suggests passivity, as if these things simply happen to us, natural disasters of attention in the digital age.  But of course, I chose to pick up my phone.  I chose to open the app. At some point, choice becomes something more complicated. 

I think often about the quality of time, how different hours weigh differently even though they all technically contain sixty identical minutes. An hour in conversation with someone I love has texture and dimension; I can recall specific moments from it days later, the way a thought developed or a joke landed.  An hour reading a difficult book feels earned, even when—especially when—I have to reread paragraphs to understand them. An hour cooking dinner has a narrative arc: raw ingredients become something nourishing.  But the scrolling hour exists in some other category entirely. It's time that passes without passing through me, leaving no mark. 

This matters more than I want it to. I'd prefer to think of these lost hours as harmless, a bit of mental downtime, the contemporary equivalent of staring out the window.  But staring out the window is actually restorative in a way that scrolling never is. Boredom, real boredom, has a kind of fertility to it.  Ideas emerge from it. The mind wanders somewhere rather than nowhere. What I feel after an hour of scrolling isn't rest but a peculiar exhaustion, as if I've been busy without accomplishing anything, engaged without connecting with anything.  My eyes hurt.  My brain feels simultaneously overstimulated and understimulated, craving more input while also desperately wanting less. 

The architecture of these platforms is designed, of course, to produce exactly this feeling. I know this.  We all know this by now. The infinite scroll, the algorithmic feed calibrated to keep you hovering in a state of semi-attention, never quite satisfied but never quite ready to leave. The slot-machine psychology of the refresh, the possibility that this time, this next pull, will deliver something genuinely interesting or important or funny enough to justify all the previous pulls that weren't.  It's brilliant, in a sinister way. Someone figured out how to monetize the exact sensation of wanting to stop but not stopping.

What disturbs me isn't just that I lose time this way, but what it suggests about the fragility of intention.  I consider myself a reasonably self-directed person. I make plans. I have goals. I value my time and try to use it deliberately. And yet, with remarkable consistency, I find myself doing something I didn't intend to do, that I don't even enjoy while I'm doing it, that I feel worse after having done.  If I can't maintain sovereignty over something as simple as whether or not to look at my phone for an hour, what does that say about my capacity for self-determination in matters that are actually complex?

This seems to me one of the central questions of modern life, though we tend to approach it obliquely, through concerns about productivity or mental health or screen time limits. The deeper issue is about agency itself. We live in an era that offers unprecedented freedom in many ways—freedom to access information, to connect with others, to shape our own narratives—and yet many of us feel less free than these possibilities suggest we should.  We feel, instead, perpetually reactive, swept along by forces we can name but not quite resist.

Work has something to do with this, the way it's expanded to fill all available space.  I remember my parents coming home from work and being done with work, a clear boundary between professional obligation and personal life. That boundary has dissolved for many of us.  Email arrives at all hours. Slack messages ping through dinner.  The expectation of availability has become the default setting, and opting out requires active resistance that can feel professionally risky. We are always a little bit working, which means we're never quite not working, which means that the time that's supposedly ours never fully belongs to us.

And so we're tired in a particular way, a tiredness that sleep doesn't fix because it's not really about insufficient rest. It's about operating in a state of continuous partial attention, always monitoring multiple channels, never fully present anywhere. The scrolling, in this context, starts to make a certain sense. It's not relaxation, but it's not exactly effort either. It exists in the same liminal space as so much of contemporary life, neither work nor leisure, neither engaging nor restful, just a way of filling time that might otherwise demand something from us.

I wonder sometimes what we're avoiding when we scroll.  Silence, perhaps.  The sound of our own thoughts. The necessity of making a decision about what to do with ourselves.  Boredom, yes, but also the things that emerge from boredom: restlessness, desire, grief, longing, the uncomfortable questions that arise when we're not distracting ourselves from them. The feed offers an infinite supply of other people's moments, other people's outrage, other people's accomplishments and failures and lunch choices.  It's deeply absorbing in aggregate, even when no individual piece of it matters at all.  It keeps us company in a way that doesn't require vulnerability or reciprocity.

There's loneliness in this, I think, even when we're using these platforms to feel connected. The connection is real but also somehow not real, present but insubstantial.  I can feel moved by something someone shares, can laugh at a joke, can feel the pleasant buzz of recognition when someone articulates something I've thought but not expressed. And yet the accumulation of these micro-interactions doesn't add up to the sustained attention that real intimacy requires. It's connection as snack food, satisfying a craving in the moment but never quite nourishing. 

I don't have a solution to any of this. I'm not going to delete my apps or throw my phone in a lake or move to a cabin in Montana, though I respect people who do. The problem isn't really the technology anyway; it's something about how we're living, the particular pressures and voids of this moment that the technology exploits so effectively. We're lonely but suspicious of vulnerability.  We're exhausted but feel we should be doing more. We're overwhelmed by information but afraid of missing something important. We're hungry for meaning but unsure where to look for it in a world that increasingly feels designed to prevent exactly the kind of sustained focus that meaning requires.

What I'm trying to do instead is notice.  To catch myself in the act of reaching for my phone and pause long enough to ask what I'm actually looking for. Usually it's nothing specific, just a vague desire to feel something or escape something or pass the time. Sometimes I can redirect that impulse into something more intentional—a walk, a conversation, picking up the book I claim I don't have time to read. Sometimes I can't, and I scroll anyway, but at least I do it consciously, aware that I'm making a choice even if it's not the choice I wish I were making.

This probably sounds modest to the point of uselessness as a strategy. But I think the practice of noticing is actually radical in its own small way. It creates a gap, however brief, between impulse and action.  It restores, at least momentarily, a sense of agency.  It acknowledges that time—my time, this one life I have—is actually mine to direct, even in an environment engineered to direct it for me. 

The hour I lost tonight will be followed by another hour, and I get to decide what to do with that one. This is obvious, but it's easy to forget. The scroll wants me to forget it. The feed wants me to believe that time is something that happens to me rather than something I'm actively spending, constantly, with every moment, whether I'm paying attention or not. The question isn't whether I'll waste some of my hours—I will, we all will, that's part of being human—but whether I'll waste them consciously or drift through them as if I have an infinite supply. 

I don't have an infinite supply.  None of us do. And there's something clarifying about remembering that, about feeling the weight of it. Not in a morbid way, but in a way that makes the next hour, the one I'm living right now, feel like something that matters. Something worth being present for. Something I might actually remember tomorrow.
