# The Quiet Erosion of Deep Time

There's a particular quality to the way time feels now, in this moment of history, that I struggle to name. It's not exactly that time moves faster, though that's the complaint I hear most often from people around me. It's more that time has become thin, stretched across too many surfaces at once, losing its depth in the process. I notice this most acutely when I try to read a book in the evening. My hand reaches for my phone every few minutes, an unconscious gesture, as automatic as breathing. Even when I manage to resist, the impulse remains, a low hum of restlessness beneath my concentration. Something in me has learned to expect interruption, to crave it even, and the sustained focus that reading requires feels almost transgressive, like I'm withholding myself from some unnamed obligation.

This fragmentation of attention didn't happen overnight, of course. It accumulated gradually, through a thousand small choices and adaptations, until one day I looked up and realized I could barely remember what it felt like to be bored. Boredom, that much-maligned state, now seems almost luxurious in retrospect. It was a kind of spaciousness, a pause in which the mind could wander without purpose, making unexpected connections, settling into itself. Now those gaps have been filled. Every moment of potential emptiness—waiting in line, riding the bus, the brief lull between tasks—has become an opportunity to check something, to scroll, to maintain what feels like necessary contact with an ever-updating stream of information.

I don't mean to sound nostalgic for some imagined past when life was simpler and attention spans were longer. Every era has its anxieties, its particular forms of distraction. What strikes me as different now is the sophistication of the systems designed to capture and hold our attention. These aren't passive technologies we choose to use; they're environments engineered to keep us engaged, to make leaving feel like missing out. The algorithms learn our patterns, our vulnerabilities, what makes us pause and click. They're remarkably good at their job, which is not to inform us or connect us, though they do those things incidentally, but to keep us present within their ecosystems for as long as possible.

The strange thing is that I chose this. We all did, in some sense. No one forced me to carry a device that buzzes with notifications, to maintain profiles on multiple platforms, to check my email before I've fully woken up in the morning. These were individual decisions, each one seemingly reasonable at the time. How else would I stay in touch with friends scattered across different cities? How else would I keep up with news, with culture, with the professional developments in my field? The utility was genuine. But utility and necessity can blur together, and somewhere along the way, what began as a tool became an environment I inhabit nearly constantly, one that shapes not just how I spend my time but how I experience time itself.

What troubles me most is the way this constant connectivity has changed my relationship with depth. Deep work, deep conversation, deep thought—these require a kind of sustained immersion that feels increasingly difficult to achieve. It's not that I can't focus when I really try; it's that the trying has become effortful in a way it didn't use to be. My attention has been trained toward the shallow end, toward rapid context-switching, toward the dopamine hit of novelty and response. When I sit down to write something substantial or work through a complex problem, I can feel the resistance, the way my mind wants to dart away toward something easier, more immediately rewarding. This isn't a moral failing. It's adaptation. My brain has learned to operate in an environment of constant stimulation, and now it protests when asked to do otherwise.

I see this same quality in my relationships, too. Conversations have become more hurried, more transactional. There's always something else to get to, another message to answer, another task demanding attention. Even when I'm physically present with someone, part of me remains tethered to elsewhere, to the device in my pocket and the entire world it contains. I notice this particularly with older people in my life, who will sometimes pause mid-conversation, comfortable with silence, while I feel an immediate urge to fill the gap, to move things along. They seem to inhabit time differently, with a patience I've somehow lost access to. Their attention hasn't been restructured by decades of rapid-fire digital interaction. They can still sit with slowness, with emptiness, without experiencing it as lack.

There's a paradox here that I keep circling back to. We have more ways to save time than ever before—automated systems, delivery services, instant communication—and yet we seem to have less time than previous generations, or at least we feel that we do. Part of this is economic, certainly. Many people work longer hours now, juggling multiple jobs or dealing with the expectation of constant availability that comes with remote work. But part of it is also perceptual. When every moment can be optimized, filled with productivity or entertainment or social maintenance, the very idea of free time becomes suspect. Doing nothing feels like waste. And so we fill our hours, our days, our lives, until we arrive at the end of a year and wonder where it went, what we did with it, whether any of it mattered.

I wonder sometimes what we're losing in this acceleration, this flattening of experience. There are certain kinds of understanding that only come from sustained attention, from returning to the same question or problem or work of art over time, allowing it to reveal layers that aren't apparent on first encounter. There are certain kinds of relationships that only deepen through long stretches of undistracted presence. There's a quality of self-knowledge that emerges from solitude and reflection, from time spent with your own thoughts rather than with an endless stream of other people's thoughts dressed up as content. These things require what I think of as deep time—not just minutes or hours, but a particular quality of temporal experience, one that's unhurried and porous, allowing for digression and discovery.

I'm not suggesting we can or should abandon the technologies that have reshaped our lives. The connectivity is real, the benefits are real, and for many people, these tools have opened up possibilities that didn't exist before. But I do think we need to be more honest about the costs, about what we're trading away in exchange for convenience and constant contact. We need to recognize that our attention is not an infinite resource, that it can be exhausted and degraded, and that the quality of our attention shapes the quality of our lives in fundamental ways.

Lately I've been experimenting with small acts of resistance. I leave my phone in another room when I read. I take walks without headphones, letting my mind wander without input. I try to notice when I'm reaching for distraction out of habit rather than genuine desire. These are tiny gestures, barely noticeable, but they create small pockets of different time, slower time, deeper time. In those moments, I can feel something shifting, some part of me that's been held taut beginning to relax. The restlessness doesn't disappear entirely, but it quiets enough that I can hear what's underneath it—curiosity, sometimes, or genuine presence, or simply the experience of being alive in this particular moment, which is all we ever really have.

I don't know if these small refusals are enough. The systems are powerful, the habits are deep, and I'm only one person trying to swim against a current that carries billions. But I've come to believe that attention is one of the last things we truly own, one of the few resources that remains genuinely ours to direct. How we spend it, what we allow to claim it, who and what we choose to give it to—these decisions add up to something like a life. And if we've lost the ability to choose, if our attention is being managed and directed and sold without our full awareness, then we've lost something essential, something worth fighting to reclaim. The fight won't be dramatic. It will look like small, ordinary moments of refusal and reclamation, like choosing depth over breadth, presence over productivity, being over doing. It will look like learning, once again, how to be bored, how to wait, how to sit with ourselves and with each other in something approaching fullness. It will look like remembering that time, real time, deep time, is not something to be filled but something to be inhabited, and that the quality of our inhabitation matters more than we've been led to believe.
